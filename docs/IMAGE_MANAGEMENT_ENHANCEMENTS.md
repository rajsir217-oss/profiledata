## 🏗️ **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**

### **Frontend Components**

#### **New Files Created:**
1. `/frontend/src/components/ImageManager.js`
2. `/frontend/src/components/ImageManager.css`

#### **Modified Files:**
1. `/frontend/src/components/EditProfile.js`
   - Integrated ImageManager component
   - Added imageOrder to form submission
   - Enhanced upload UI

#### **Key Features:**

**ImageManager Component:**
```javascript
<ImageManager
  existingImages={existingImages}
  setExistingImages={setExistingImages}
  imagesToDelete={imagesToDelete}
  setImagesToDelete={setImagesToDelete}
  onError={setErrorMsg}
/>
```

**Drag & Drop Logic:**
- HTML5 Drag and Drop API
- Reorders array on drop
- Optimistic UI updates
- No external libraries needed

**Profile Pic Selection:**
```javascript
const setAsProfilePic = (index) => {
  const reorderedImages = [...existingImages];
  const [removed] = reorderedImages.splice(index, 1);
  reorderedImages.unshift(removed); // Move to first
  setExistingImages(reorderedImages);
};
```

---

### **Backend Updates**

#### **Modified Files:**
1. `/fastapi_backend/routes.py`
   - Added `imageOrder` parameter to `/profile/{username}` PUT endpoint
   - Image reordering logic preserves user's chosen order
   - Logs image operations for debugging

#### **Image Reordering Logic:**
```python
# Handle image reordering if provided
if imageOrder and existing_images:
    ordered_urls = json.loads(imageOrder)
    # Extract relative paths and reorder
    ordered_paths = []
    for url in ordered_urls:
        rel_path = extract_relative_path(url)
        if rel_path in existing_images:
            ordered_paths.append(rel_path)
    existing_images = ordered_paths
```

**API Endpoint:**
```
PUT /profile/{username}
FormData:
  - imageOrder: string (JSON array of image URLs in desired order)
  - imagesToDelete: string (JSON array of URLs to delete)
  - images: List[File] (new images to upload)
  - ... other profile fields
```

## 🐛 **KNOWN LIMITATIONS & FUTURE WORK**

### **Current Limitations:**
1. **Drag & Drop on Mobile**: Limited touch drag support (arrow buttons compensate)
2. **No Undo**: Deleted photos can't be recovered (planned: trash bin with restore)
3. **No Bulk Operations**: Can't select multiple photos at once
4. **No Photo Editing**: Must edit externally before upload

### **Planned Improvements:**
1. **Undo/Redo Stack**: Track changes for rollback
2. **Photo Versioning**: Keep old versions for 30 days
3. **Smart Auto-Crop**: AI-powered face centering
4. **Duplicate Detection**: Warn when uploading similar photos
5. **Compression**: Auto-compress large files

3. Show drag action: "Drag to reorder"
4. Show star button: "Click ⭐ to set as profile pic"
