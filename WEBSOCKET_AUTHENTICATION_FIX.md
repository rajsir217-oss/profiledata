# WebSocket Authentication Fix
**Date:** October 9, 2025  
**Issue:** WebSocket not connecting - missing username in headers

---

## 🐛 Problem

**Symptoms:**
- Messages still using polling
- Backend logs show NO WebSocket connections
- No "User connected" logs
- No Socket.IO events
- Frontend console shows no WebSocket connection

**Root Cause:**
- Backend expects `HTTP_USERNAME` header for authentication
- Frontend was NOT sending username in headers
- WebSocket connection failed silently
- Fell back to polling

---

## 🔍 Analysis

### Backend Code (websocket_manager.py):
```python
@sio.event
async def connect(sid, environ):
    username = environ.get('HTTP_USERNAME')  # ← Expects header
    if username:
        # Register user
    else:
        logger.warning(f"⚠️ Connection without username")  # ← This was happening
```

### Frontend Code (BEFORE):
```javascript
this.socket = io('http://localhost:8000', {
  path: '/socket.io',
  transports: ['websocket', 'polling'],
  // ❌ NO extraHeaders - username not sent!
});
```

**Result:**
- Frontend connects to WebSocket
- Backend receives connection
- Backend looks for `HTTP_USERNAME` header
- Header not found → `username = None`
- Backend logs warning: "Connection without username"
- User not registered in `online_users`
- Messages can't be delivered via WebSocket
- Falls back to polling

---

## ✅ Solution

### Added `extraHeaders` to Socket.IO Connection:

```javascript
// frontend/src/services/socketService.js
this.socket = io('http://localhost:8000', {
  path: '/socket.io',
  transports: ['websocket', 'polling'],
  reconnection: true,
  reconnectionDelay: 1000,
  reconnectionAttempts: 5,
  extraHeaders: {
    'username': username  // ← NOW SENDS USERNAME
  }
});
```

**Result:**
- Frontend connects with username in headers
- Backend receives `HTTP_USERNAME` header
- Backend registers user in `online_users`
- Messages can be delivered via WebSocket
- Real-time messaging works!

## 🔄 Complete Flow Now

### WebSocket Connection:

```
1. User logs in
   ↓
2. socketService.connect('shyam_patel')
   ↓
3. Socket.IO connects with extraHeaders: {username: 'shyam_patel'}
   ↓
4. Backend receives connection
   ↓
5. Backend extracts: username = environ.get('HTTP_USERNAME')
   ↓
6. username = 'shyam_patel' ✅
   ↓
7. Backend: online_users['shyam_patel'] = sid
   ↓
8. Backend: redis.set_user_online('shyam_patel')
   ↓
9. Backend logs: "🟢 User 'shyam_patel' connected (sid: abc123)"
   ↓
10. Backend broadcasts: user_online event
    ↓
11. WebSocket connection established ✅
```

### Message Sending:

```
1. User A sends message to User B
   ↓
2. socketService.sendMessage('user_b', 'Hello')
   ↓
3. WebSocket emits: send_message event
   ↓
4. Backend receives message
   ↓
5. Backend checks: Is user_b in online_users?
   ↓
6. YES ✅ (because user_b connected with username header)
   ↓
7. Backend emits: new_message to user_b's socket
   ↓
8. User B receives message INSTANTLY
   ↓
9. Message appears in < 100ms ✅
```

## 📊 Before vs After

### Before (Broken):

**Connection:**
```
Frontend connects
→ No username in headers ❌
→ Backend: username = None
→ Backend: "Connection without username"
→ User NOT registered
→ WebSocket useless
```

**Messaging:**
```
Send message
→ Backend checks online_users
→ User not found (not registered)
→ Falls back to Redis polling
→ 0-30 second delay ❌
```

### After (Fixed):

**Connection:**
```
Frontend connects
→ Username in extraHeaders ✅
→ Backend: username = 'shyam_patel'
→ Backend: "User 'shyam_patel' connected"
→ User registered in online_users
→ WebSocket ready
```

**Messaging:**
```
Send message
→ Backend checks online_users
→ User found ✅
→ Delivers via WebSocket
→ < 100ms delay ✅
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Test WebSocket Connection:

1. **Logout and login again**
2. **Check browser console** - Should see:
   ```
   🔌 Attempting to connect to Socket.IO server
   👤 Username for connection: shyam_patel
   📡 Socket.IO client initialized: true
   🔌 Connected to WebSocket server
   👤 Registering user as online: shyam_patel
   🔍 Socket ID: abc123xyz
   ✅ Emitted user_online event
   ```

3. **Check backend logs** - Should see:
   ```
   🟢 User 'shyam_patel' connected (sid: abc123xyz)
   ```

4. **Send a message**
5. **Check console** - Should see:
   ```
   💬 Message sent via WebSocket
   ```

6. **Check backend logs** - Should see:
   ```
   💬 Real-time message: shyam_patel → rama
   ✅ Message delivered to rama via WebSocket
   ```

7. **Recipient receives instantly** (< 1 second)

## 🔧 Files Modified

### Frontend:

1. **`socketService.js`**
   - Added `extraHeaders` with username
   - Added console log for username
   - Ensures authentication on connection

---

## 🎯 Expected Backend Logs

### When User Connects:

```
🟢 User 'shyam_patel' connected (sid: abc123xyz)
```

### When Message Sent:

```
💬 Real-time message: shyam_patel → rama
✅ Message delivered to rama via WebSocket
```

### When User Disconnects:

```
🔌 Client disconnected: abc123xyz
⚪ User shyam_patel went offline
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Still seeing "Connection without username":

1. **Check console logs:**
   ```javascript
   // Should see:
   👤 Username for connection: shyam_patel
   ```

2. **Hard refresh:** Ctrl+Shift+R (Cmd+Shift+R)

3. **Clear cache and logout/login**

4. **Check if username is defined:**
   ```javascript
   // In browser console
   localStorage.getItem('username')
   // Should return: "shyam_patel"
   ```

### WebSocket still not connecting:

1. **Check backend is running:**
   ```bash
   ps aux | grep uvicorn
   # Should show: main:socket_app
   ```

2. **Check CORS settings:**
   ```python
   # websocket_manager.py
   sio = socketio.AsyncServer(
       cors_allowed_origins='*'  # Should allow all origins
   )
   ```

3. **Check port 8000 is open:**
   ```bash
   lsof -i :8000
   ```

4. **Restart backend:**
   ```bash
   pkill -f uvicorn
   ./startb.sh
   ```
