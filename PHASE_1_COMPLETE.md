## Testing the Current Implementation

### Register a New User
1. Go to `/register`
2. Fill in basic info (username, password, name, etc.)
3. Scroll down to "Dating Preferences" section
4. Fill in new fields (all optional)
5. Add bio (max 200 characters)
6. Upload images
7. Submit

### View in Admin Dashboard
1. Login as admin (username: admin, password: admin)
2. Go to Admin Dashboard
3. See new columns:
   - Age (calculated)
   - Days Active (calculated)
   - Message counts (currently 0)

## What Still Needs Implementation

### Priority 2: EditProfile.js (Similar to Register.js)
Need to add the same 14 fields to EditProfile component.

### Priority 3: Profile.js Display
Need to display all new fields in the profile view, organized into sections.

### Priority 4: PII Security System
- Mask sensitive fields
- Access request system
- Approval workflow

### Priority 5: Matching/Search System
- Search criteria builder
- Saved searches
- Search execution
- Results display

### Priority 6: Messaging System
- Send/receive messages
- Conversation threads
- Update message counts

## Next Steps

I recommend implementing in this order:

1. **Update EditProfile.js** (30 minutes)
   - Copy the new fields from Register.js
   - Add to EditProfile form
   - Update API call

2. **Update Profile.js** (30 minutes)
   - Display new fields in organized sections
   - Add nice formatting

3. **Implement PII Security** (3-4 hours)
   - Most critical for dating app
   - Protects user privacy

4. **Implement Matching** (2-3 hours)
   - Core dating app feature
   - Users expect this

5. **Add Messaging** (4-5 hours)
   - Communication between users
   - Complete the dating experience

## Code Status

### ✅ Fully Implemented
- Backend registration with all fields
- Frontend registration form with all fields
- Admin computed columns

### ⏳ Needs Implementation
- EditProfile.js (add new fields)
- Profile.js (display new fields)
- PII masking
- Access requests
- Search/matching
- Messaging

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `routes.py` - Registration endpoint updated
2. ✅ `Register.js` - All 14 fields added
3. ✅ `AdminPage.js` - Computed columns added

## Files That Need Updates

1. ⏳ `EditProfile.js` - Add 14 new fields
2. ⏳ `Profile.js` - Display 14 new fields
3. ⏳ Create `pii_security.py` - PII masking utility
4. ⏳ Create `AccessRequestButton.js` - Request PII access
5. ⏳ Create `AccessRequestsPage.js` - Manage requests
6. ⏳ Implement `MatchingCriteria.js` - Full version
7. ⏳ Create `SearchResults.js` - Display matches
8. ⏳ Create `MessagingPage.js` - Basic messaging

## Summary

**Phase 1 is 60% complete!**

✅ Backend ready for all new fields
✅ Registration form has all new fields
✅ Admin shows computed fields

Still needed:
- EditProfile update
- Profile display update
- PII security
- Matching system
- Messaging system

The foundation is solid. Users can now register with comprehensive dating profiles. The data is being stored correctly in the database.

Would you like me to:
A) Continue with EditProfile.js and Profile.js updates?
B) Jump to PII Security implementation?
C) Focus on Matching/Search system?
D) Provide complete code templates for all remaining work?
