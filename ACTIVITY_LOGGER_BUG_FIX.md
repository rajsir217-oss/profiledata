# Activity Logger Bug Fix - ObjectId Conversion

## Problem
Activity Logs page showed 0 logs even though logs existed in the database.

## Root Cause
```
ValidationError: 1 validation error for ActivityLog
_id
  Input should be a valid string [type=string_type, input_value=ObjectId('68f999ccef0be71d2d83461f')]
```

MongoDB returns `_id` as `ObjectId`, but Pydantic model expected a string. This caused the API to fail silently when retrieving logs.

## Solution
**File:** `fastapi_backend/services/activity_logger.py`

Added ObjectId-to-string conversion in `get_logs()` method:

```python
# Convert ObjectId to string for each log
for log in logs:
    if "_id" in log:
        log["_id"] = str(log["_id"])

return [ActivityLog(**log) for log in logs], total
```

## Test Results
Before fix:
```
❌ ValidationError: ObjectId not valid string
```

After fix:
```
✅ Total logs: 4
✅ Returned logs: 4
  1. admin: user_login
  2. aadhyadubey079: favorite_added  
  3. aadhyadubey079: profile_viewed (8th time)
  4. aadhyadubey079: profile_viewed (7th time)
```

## Logs Were Being Created
The activity logger WAS working and creating logs:
- ✅ Profile views logged
- ✅ Login attempts logged  
- ✅ Favorites logged
- ✅ Database had 4 entries

**BUT** the API endpoint failed to return them due to the ObjectId conversion issue.

## How to Test
1. Restart backend: `./bstart.sh`
2. Refresh Activity Logs page
3. Should see 4+ entries

## Files Modified
1. `fastapi_backend/services/activity_logger.py` - Added ObjectId conversion

## Similar Issues to Watch For
This same pattern is needed anywhere MongoDB documents are converted to Pydantic models:
- Always convert `_id: ObjectId` to `_id: str`
- Check all `.find()` operations that return raw documents
- Verify Pydantic models can handle MongoDB's native types

**Status:** Fixed ✅  
**Date:** October 22, 2025  
**Impact:** Activity Logs now displays all logged activities
