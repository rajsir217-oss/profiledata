### Method 2: Direct API Test

**Approve a user via API:**

```bash
# Get auth token first
TOKEN="your_admin_jwt_token"

# Approve user (replace 'testuser' with actual username)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/verification/admin/approve/testuser \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"

# Response should include:
# {
#   "success": true,
#   "message": "User testuser approved successfully",
#   "accountStatus": "active",
#   "emailSent": true  ← Should be true
# }
```

**Check backend logs:**
```
✅ Welcome email sent to testuser at user@example.com
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Email Not Received

**Check 1: Email address exists in user document**
```bash
mongosh matrimonialDB
db.users.findOne(
  {username: "testuser"},
  {contactEmail: 1, email: 1, firstName: 1}
)
```

**Check 2: SMTP configured**
```bash
# In .env file:
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your@email.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=your_app_password
FROM_EMAIL=noreply@yourapp.com
FROM_NAME=Your App Name
```

**Check 3: Backend logs**
Look for:
- ✅ "Welcome email sent to..."
- ⚠️ "Failed to send welcome email..."
- ⚠️ "No email address found..."

### emailSent is false

**Possible causes:**
1. No email in user document (contactEmail or email field)
2. SMTP not configured
3. SMTP credentials invalid
4. Network/firewall blocking port 587

**Solution:**
```bash
# Test SMTP manually
cd fastapi_backend
python3 -c "
from services.email_verification_service import EmailVerificationService
from motor.motor_asyncio import AsyncIOMotorClient
import asyncio

async def test():
    client = AsyncIOMotorClient('mongodb://localhost:27017')
    db = client.matrimonialDB
    service = EmailVerificationService(db)
    result = await service.send_welcome_email(
        'testuser', 
        'your@email.com',
        'Test User'
    )
    print(f'Email sent: {result}')
    client.close()

asyncio.run(test())
"
```
