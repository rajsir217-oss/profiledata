Migration: Remove workLocation field from all user profiles
Date: October 24, 2025
Reason: workLocation is now tracked per work experience entry, not as a separate field

This migration:
1. Removes the 'workLocation' field from all users
2. Work location is now stored in workExperience array entries
3. Reports number of affected documents
