/Users/rajsiripuram02/opt/appsrc/profiledata/frontend/node_modules/react-router/CHANGELOG.md | 1546 |   - Remove the `unstable_` prefix from the [`useBlocker`](https //reactrouter.com/v6/hooks/use-blocker) hook as it's been in use for enough time that we are confident in the API. We do not plan to remove the prefix from `unstable_usePrompt` due to differences in how browsers handle `window.confirm` that prevent React Router from guaranteeing consistent/correct behavior. ([#10991](https //github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10991))
