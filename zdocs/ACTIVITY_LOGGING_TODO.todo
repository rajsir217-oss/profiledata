## üìã Implementation Phases

### **Phase 1: High Priority - User-Facing Actions** (16 items)
*These are visible user actions that provide immediate value for KPIs*

#### Profile Management (8)
- [ ] **Photo Uploaded** - `/profile/{username}` PUT endpoint (images field)

---

### **Phase 3: Lower Priority - Admin & System** (18 items)

#### Authentication (2)
- [ ] **Session Expired** - When token expires
  - Location: `auth/jwt_auth.py` or frontend interceptor
  - Add: Log when 401 due to expiration
  
- [ ] **Password Changed** - Password update endpoint
  - Location: Search for password change endpoint

#### PII & Access (4)

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Pattern

For each activity type, follow this pattern:

```python
# In the relevant endpoint
try:
    from services.activity_logger import get_activity_logger
    from models.activity_models import ActivityType
    activity_logger = get_activity_logger()
    await activity_logger.log_activity(
        username=username,
        action_type=ActivityType.ACTION_NAME,
        target_username=target_username,  # if applicable
        metadata={"relevant": "data"},
        ip_address=request.client.host if request.client else None
    )
except Exception as log_err:
    logger.warning(f"‚ö†Ô∏è Failed to log activity: {log_err}")
```

### For Event-Driven Activities:
If the activity already has an event dispatcher call, the activity is logged automatically through `event_dispatcher.py` mapping.

## üìä Priority Scoring

**High Priority (Phase 1):** User actions that drive engagement metrics
- Photo management (retention indicator)
- Search behavior (feature usage)
- Matching views (core feature)

**Medium Priority (Phase 2):** Communication and navigation tracking
- Messaging patterns (engagement)
- Page views (usage patterns)

**Low Priority (Phase 3):** Admin actions and system events
- Admin operations (audit trail)
- System events (debugging)

---

## üéØ Quick Wins (Easy Implementations)

These can be done quickly because the endpoints are already instrumented:

1. **Matching Criteria Updated** - Just add logging to preferences endpoint
2. **Search Performed** - Add logging to existing search endpoint
3. **Top/L3V3L Matches Viewed** - Add logging to match endpoints
4. **Conversation Started** - Check message count in send_message
5. **Ticket Resolved** - Add to existing ticket status endpoint

---

## üìù Notes

- **IP Address:** All new activities should capture IP via `request.client.host`
- **Request Object:** Add `request: Request` parameter to endpoints that don't have it
- **Metadata:** Include relevant context (e.g., search query, fields changed, etc.)
- **Error Handling:** Wrap activity logging in try/catch - never block main operation
- **Event Dispatcher:** Check if activity is already mapped in `event_dispatcher.py`

## ‚úÖ Completion Checklist

After implementing each activity type:

- [ ] Add activity logging in relevant endpoint
- [ ] Add `request: Request` parameter if missing
- [ ] Capture IP address
- [ ] Include meaningful metadata
- [ ] Test by triggering the action
- [ ] Verify it appears in Activity Logs UI
- [ ] Update this document
