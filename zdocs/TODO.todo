# TODO List

## UI/UX Improvements
add to todo.todo "review for opportuniites -- add a factory function to api.js that creates properly configured axios instances with session handling and others, then update components to use it -- it will eliminates code issues later"



1. ✅ **Profile Pictures - 3-Column Visibility System** (Dec 28, 2025)
   - Design: `zdocs/PHOTO_VISIBILITY_DESIGN.md`
   - Backend: `routes.py` - GET/PUT `/profile/{username}/image-visibility`
   - Frontend: `PhotoVisibilityManager.js` + CSS
   - Migration: `migrations/migrate_image_visibility.py`
   - **Buckets:** Profile Pic (1) | Member Visible (4) | On Request (within 5)
   - **Status:** Core implementation complete, needs integration testing
   - **Next:** Replace ImageManager with PhotoVisibilityManager in Dashboard, run migration

2. membership fee - payment - gateway integeration - wikipedia style -- link to "promocode"(implmented)
3. on profile page -- from search - navigate to profile by clicking left|right the profile images are not refreshing as per the profile
4. moderator role - free user permissions plus below
   1. admin Dashboard
   2. Invitation Management
   3. http://localhost:3000/announcement-management
   4. http://localhost:3000/poll-management
   5. http://localhost:3000/admin-reports
5. in profile search query should always pick only active accountstatus members only (i think it does)
6. in dashboard -- if a profile is in shortlisted or in favorites and the profile accountstatus is changed to other than the "active" the dashboard should remove that profile from shortlist/favorites - it is not happening

###Common causes for slow React dev server:

First start after cache clear - Normal, rebuilding everything
ESLint on 315 files - Takes time
Large CSS files (5,531 lines in SearchPage.css)
Source map generation
To speed up future starts:

 
Disabling ESLint during dev
Code splitting
Removing unused dependencies
