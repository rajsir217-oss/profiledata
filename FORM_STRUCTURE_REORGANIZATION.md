## 💡 Rationale for Changes

### **Bio to Top:**
- **First impression matters** - Users see the tagline immediately
- **Consistency** - Same carousel UI as other description fields
- **Better flow** - Short, catchy intro before detailed info

### **Work Location After Work Experience:**
- **Logical grouping** - All work-related fields together
- **Better context** - Users add work experience, then specify location
- **Cleaner structure** - Related fields adjacent

### **Dating Preferences Merged:**
- **Reduced sections** - Less overwhelming
- **Unified preferences** - All partner/personal preferences in one place
- **Better UX** - Single section for all matching criteria

### **Removed Occupation/Income:**
- **Redundant** - Occupation covered in Work Experience
- **Privacy** - Income range too sensitive
- **Simplified** - Fewer fields = less friction
